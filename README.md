# Towards a Mechanization of Standard ML in Beluga using Harpoon

The [metatheory of Standard ML](https://github.com/SMLFamily/The-Mechanization-of-Standard-ML) was mechanized by Lee, Crary and Harper using [Twelf](http://twelf.org/).
We set out to repeat this mechanization in order to assess the practicality and robustness of [Beluga](http://complogic.cs.mcgill.ca/beluga/), a programming and proof environment with support for contextual types, using [Harpoon](https://beluga-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/harpoon), a more accessible frontend to Beluga.
